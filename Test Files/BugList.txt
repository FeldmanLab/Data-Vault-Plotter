List of bugs:

Sometimes plotsetup accept doesn't work, doesn't go to extents (livePlot) (Not explicitly fixed, but
hasn't appeared in a while)

plotSetup shuts down randomly. Only happens when trying to setup plots while other plots are running
and being updated, but otherwise no correlations noticed. 

Remove plot doesn't work in setup window (just not yet implemented)

Todo list:
Stop from autoresizing every time graph reloads
Be able to change plot titles
Figure out plotting same axes
Each time plotLive is clicked, refresh data vaut
